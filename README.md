Are you high? Maybe. To play is simple! You will start with 300 points. A card between 1 and 13 will be displayed. Yours is to guess if the next card will be higher or lower! For ever guess correct, you will gain another 100 points, but get it wrong and 75 points will be taken! Reach 0 points and it's GAME OVER!
